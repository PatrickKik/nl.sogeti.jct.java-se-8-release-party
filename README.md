Java SE 8 Release Party
=======================

Examples for our Java SE 8 Release Party.

Every example consists of (at least) two classes: ExampleName7 and ExampleName8.

The first is a piece of code written in Java SE 7 style.
It's up to you to rewrite this to Java SE 8.

The latter is the same example, but it makes  use of Java SE 8.
Note that it is not *the* answer, but *a* answer.
